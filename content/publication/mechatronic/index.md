  This article describes the mechatronic design of a
  delivery octarotor drone equipped with safety features including
  protective bumpers for its propellers, parachute, and retractable
  gear. A GNSS-RTK unit provides extensive pose-refinement for
  trajectory tracking, while an RGB-Depth Camera provides dis-
  tance measurements from any present obstacles. A deep learning
  algorithm classifies any objects into certain categories (i.e.,
  balloons, drones) followed by a trajectory avoidance algorithm.
  An onboard computer handles these sensor measurements and
  communicates with the autopilot for adjusting the trajectory.
  At the same time, it provides HD-live video feed to the base
  station and runs any onboard ROS-services. The resulting drone
  can safely land within a circular area of radius 1.5 m, while
  flying over, under and around obstacles or buildings. The carried
  payload is handled by a dual linear actuator gripper that releases
  it upon the droneâ€™s precise landing.
